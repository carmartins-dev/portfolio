# Work In Progress

## About me
I've worked as a consultant and project manager in the financial services and telecommunications industries for ten years, but my passion is game development. For this reason I've learned game development in unity and created a game on my free time. Maybe one day this hobby will become my career.

## Unnamed Isometric ARPG Prototype

### cover image

My earnest attempt at making a game ended when I accepted that it was too much for one single person. Not that it is impossible, but the scope of what I had in mind required too much time for something to be done after hours.

Still, I had a lot of fun developing this prototype and I was able to explore some interesting ideas.

Both the isometric look of the game and the story heavy planned for it was inspired on titles such as Final Fantasy Tactics. Even though the game was not played by turns, I decided to keep the game elements locked to a grid logic. I felt this was the best approach to limit the scope and be able to assert more control over the gameplay.
